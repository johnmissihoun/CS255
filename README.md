Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design?
The owner of DriverPass would like to create software that allows for good driving training for students. The owner of driver pass company is our client. The goal is to create a system in which users can register himself for this course. The system has many features where students can create their account, have the ability of selecting a package, receive online training and attempt online exams, and a trainer will give them training on road. The owner has access to all the accounts of his employers and students. He can download files without internet. He can delete any account if someone who leaves the company. 

What did you do particularly well?
I think I did well in creating a design that encompasses all the requirements from the owner into the software. By meeting all these requirements it provides the owner the exact product he has in mind with minimal changes necessary. 

If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
I would focus on the functional requirements of the project. This is because this is the most important part of the software we are creating for DriverPass and as time goes on it will continue to evolve and change. Allowing for flexibility and future changes is key to creating a good product for the owner of Driver Pass. To improve this, getting more feedback from the different users of the software will be beneficial as I would know exactly what everyone wants out of this. Listening to your audience is very important.  

How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
To incorporate the User’s needs, I gathered all the requirements from the client. Next is to sort these requirements into small individual pieces. By doing this I was able to create the different user classes and what their functions entailed. 

How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?
First it is important to see what the owner of the software already has, or what ideas they want to focus on for the software. Based on their ideas and what is already created, I learn what needs improvement and how to make those changes if necessary. Going forward in the future, I have learned the importance of receiving feedback as you are working on software.
